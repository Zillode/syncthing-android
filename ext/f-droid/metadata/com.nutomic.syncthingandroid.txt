Summary:Syncthing replaces Dropbox and BitTorrent Sync with something open, trustworthy and decentralized.
Description:
This is the first attempt at an Android port of syncthing. Please understand
that this is not stable yet, and read the first start dialog carefully.

Syncthing replaces Dropbox and BitTorrent Sync with something open,
trustworthy and decentralized. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to
choose where it is stored, if it is shared with some third party and how it's
transmitted over the Internet.

Using syncthing, that control is returned to you.
